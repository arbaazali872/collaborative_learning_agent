want to understand what outliers are and the process of removing them

Great question! Outliers can really affect a model's performance. Let's figure this out together with an example. Imagine you're working on predicting house prices in a neighborhood.

Suppose most houses are between 200,000 and 400,000, but then there's one house listed at $2 million. How do you think that outlier might impact your model?

not sure but I think it will impact the models' weights for that feature....

Exactly! That super expensive house could pull the model's understanding of typical prices. Now, thinking about that, what do you think we might do with that outlier? Would we leave it, or try to handle it differently?

well I think we should try handling it

That makes sense. To handle it, we first need to find out which data points are outliers. How do you think we might identify these unusual points? Do you have any ideas or methods in mind?

no I don't know any methods till now

No worries! Let's brainstorm together. For our house prices example, what if we looked at how prices are spread out? Like, are most houses between 200k and 400k, and then a few are way above that? How could we measure or visualize this to spot those big jumps?

maybe we can use the boxplot

Exactly! A boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. Do you remember how outliers show up on a boxplot?

no I dont remember that

That's okay! Let's think about it together. Imagine a boxplot as a box with lines extending from it. The box shows the middle 50% of the data, right? Now, if there are points that are far away from the box, what do you think those might be?

well some would still be normal distribution, but some very far away will be outlier

Exactly! Those points far from the box are often considered outliers. Typically, on a boxplot, if a point is beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the quartiles, it's flagged as an outlier.

Does that make sense? Or should we try to work through an example with some numbers?

example would be fine

Great! Let's do that. Suppose we have house prices: 200k, 220k, 250k, 300k, 350k, 400k, and then one at $2 million.

First, what do you think the median is? (You can guess or tell me what you'd do to find it.)

325k

Close! Actually, since we have 7 values, the median is the 4th number when sorted. Let's list them in order: 200k, 220k, 250k, 300k, 350k, 400k, $2 million.

Which one is the middle?

300k

Exactly! The median is $300k. Now, what about the quartiles? Can you tell me what the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) are? Or do you want to go through how to find them?

find them for me please

Sure! Let's do it step-by-step.

Since we have 7 data points, the median is the 4th: 300k. Now, for Q1, we look at the lower half: 200k, 220k, 250k.

How would you find Q1 from these three?

idk

No worries! When you have an odd number of points in the lower half, like these three, Q1 is the median of that group. So, what’s the middle value among 200k, 220k, and $250k?

idk

No problem! Let's look at those three: 200k, 220k, and $250k. Which one is right in the middle? Think about it as lining them up from smallest to largest.

200k

Not quite—can you see which one is right in the middle when they're in order? Which is between the others?

220k

Exactly! So, Q1 is 220k. Now, let’s do the same for the upper half: 350k, 400k, and 2 million. What's the median here?

400k

Yes! So, Q3 is 400k. Now, do you remember how we decide if the 2 million is an outlier based on these quartiles?

no

No worries! The common rule is to look at the interquartile range (IQR), which is Q3 minus Q1. Then, outliers are points that are beyond 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 or Q3.

Want to try calculating the IQR with these numbers?

no I got it IQR = 180k

Exactly! So, IQR = 400k − 220k = $180k.

Now, to find outliers, we look beyond Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. Want to help me calculate those thresholds?

Final Outlier Thresholds:

Lower bound: –50,000
Upper bound: 670,000

Right! So, any data point below -50,000 or above 670,000 would be considered an outlier. Since our 2 million house is way above 670,000, it's flagged as an outlier.

Does that fit with what you'd expect? Or do you want to explore what to do with these outliers once identified?

yeah what do we do with them once identified?

Good question! What do you think—should we just remove the outliers, or are there other options? Like, maybe adjusting them or transforming the data? Or do you think keeping or removing depends on the situation?

yeah I thjink it should depend on the situation

Exactly! It often depends on the context. For example, if that $2 million house is a real property with a unique feature, maybe it’s an important data point. But if it’s a measurement error or anomaly, we might consider removing or adjusting it.

Would you like to think through a specific scenario where you'd choose to keep or remove outliers?

in the situation you explained lets say that 2 million is a real value based off of some features, now what to do with it?

Great! So if that $2 million house is a real value, based on features like size, location, or special amenities, what do you think might happen if we keep it in the dataset? And what might happen if we remove it?

I wouldn't wanna remove it, we loose a good datapoint, and wouldn't wanna keep it because it will effect the model training, so what are the methods to dealing with it or transforming it?

Exactly, you’ve got the right intuition. There are a few common ways to handle such outliers without just removing them. For example, what do you think about transforming data—like taking a log or square root? How might that help?

yeah maybe log will help, I think i udnerstand now, is that al we do with outliers?

Good! Log transforms can reduce the impact of big outliers. But there are other options too—like capping them at a certain percentile (called winsorizing), or using robust models that are less sensitive to outliers.

Would you like to explore any of these methods in more detail?

yeah lets understand a bit about winsorizing and then I think I will undertand the whole topic

Great choice! So, winsorizing involves replacing the extreme outliers with the nearest value that's not an outlier. For example, if your upper threshold is 670,000, and you have a house at 2 million, you'd replace that 2 million value with 670,000.

What do you think might be the advantage of doing that? And do you see any potential downside?

Advantage: Winsorizing reduces the influence of extreme outliers, making your statistics (like mean and variance) more stable and representative of the bulk of the data.

Potential downside: It distorts real extreme values, which may hide important insights or genuine rare events.

Exactly! You’ve nailed it. Winsorizing can make the model less sensitive to extreme values, but it also risks hiding genuine rare cases that might be important.

So, in practice, choosing whether to winsorize depends on whether those outliers are errors, or meaningful data points.

Would you like to review how you might decide which method to use in a real project?

I think i understand the whole concept now

That's awesome! Would you like to try explaining it back to me in your own words? Just to make sure it really cl
